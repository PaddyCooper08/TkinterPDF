#Setup


#Windows
If using from the python file, simply activate the venv by using cd to get into venv/Scripts/ then do activate.bat to activate it.
Then just run the python file however you usually do it.

#From exe
To run from the exe just put the exe file into the same directory as the venv and the main.py file and double click. It may take a while to startup - this is normal.
